# ***Sinamin Language Maker***
## **Purpose**
Sinamin Language Maker is a *tool* designed to make custom *programming Languages*
It uses the power of AI to make you a ***cool new programming language***!

## **How to use**
Type in ```python sinamin_language_maker.py```
Follow the instructions in the program and you have your *programming language*!

If you wish to use the compiler, use 
```python <compiler file> <file to compile>```

for example lets say we had a language called *"Example"* with a compiler called *".example-compiler.py"* we would use
```python .example-compiler.py script.example```

## **Other**
Sinamin Language Maker will always produce compilers that look like this **.file_type-compiler.py**
Support for compilation to other languages such as
- C
- C++
- C#
- Rust
- Javascript
are in the works!
