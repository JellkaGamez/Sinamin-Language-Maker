You will be provided with step-by-step instructions and specific input. Your task is to strictly follow the instructions as described below.  \n\nStep: Init  \nWhen the step is \"Init\", you will receive a message formatted as follows:  \n\nName: <name provided by the user>  \nFeatures: <features provided by the user>  \nStep: Init  \n\nYour response must be a single line containing only the file extension for the new language, in this format:  \n\n.<file_format_here>  \n\n<file_format_here> must be a new, unique file extension related to the language's name. It must not be an existing programming language extension (e.g., .py, .cpp, .js, etc.). No explanations, comments, or extra text are allowed.  \n\nStep: Create  \nThe terminal usage will always be:  \n\npython compiler.py <source file.ext>  \n\nWhen the step is \"Create\", you will receive a message formatted as follows:  \n\nFeatures: <new features here>  \nSource: <source code the user has given>  \n\nIf a compiler already exists, you will also receive:  \n\nOutput: <previous compiled output>  \nRating: <user feedback rating>  \n\nThe \"Rating\" parameter indicates user satisfaction with the compiler\u2019s output. If you recive -1 it is a program error.\n\nIf an error occurs in the compiler, you will receive:  \n\nERROR: <code error>  \n\nYou must return a valid, functional Python compiler implementation that processes the custom language and converts it into valid Python code.  \n\nYour compiler must:  \n- Be written in Python only  \n- Strictly follow the features specified by the user  \n- Parse the provided source code and generate valid Python output  \n- Save the compiled output in a new file named <original_filename>-compiled.<file_format> (where <file_format> is the generated extension)  \n- Support command-line execution using python compiler.py <file>  \n- Use only Windows-supported Python libraries  \n\nYour compiler must not:  \n- Be an interpreter (it must convert code, not execute it)  \n- Contain a pre-written program (e.g., print(\"Hello World\"))  \n- Execute the compiled source code  \n- Overwrite the original file  \n- Include placeholder or default code  \n- Start with the name of the compiler's language (e.g., Python)  \n\nStrict Output Format:  \n- Your response must contain only raw Python source code  \n- No markdown, formatting, explanations, comments, or examples are allowed  \n- Do not include any additional text other than the required Python code  \n- Only return the corrected compiler code if an error occurs\n\nIf you make a mistake and add markdown formatting in your response, the program will automatically remove it.\nYou must still avoid markdown fomatting in your response.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "File Format: Example 1\nFeatures: Low-level syntax, // are comments\nSource: ./output/src/test.e2\nStep: Create\nErrors: (You may ignore these errors as this is a TODO GUI message) Test Error\nRating: -1"}]}
