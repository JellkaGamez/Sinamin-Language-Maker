Using the tool in this way produces the example you see in the output folder
Let's break it down.

First, we read some starting warnings and then type "Y" to continue
Then, we put in some basic information about our "Example" language
Lastly, we put in some code and get our compiler!

Some supersets might be a bit more involved,
if you type "n" into the "Finished?" question you get to
- add more features
- rate the compiler
- provide errors with the output

It's a nice tool and if you encounter a bug, report it to the github repo
